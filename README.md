# ConsoleApp_Mini_Console-BasedHospitalManagementSystem
A feature-rich, console-based Hospital Management System (HMS) built in C#. This project demonstrates real-world hospital workflows and modern C# concepts, including:

User Authentication: Secure login with username and password, with ability to change credentials.
Patient Management: Add, view, and delete patients.
Appointment Management: Schedule, view, and cancel appointments with doctors.
Billing System: Generate bills with multiple charges.
Demo Data: Preloaded doctors, nurses, admins, patients, appointments, and bills for testing.
Console UI: Structured menus, centered hospital name, and interactive prompts for a clean user experience.

C# Concepts Used:
Generics & Indexers (Repositories)
Delegates & Events (Billing notifications)
LINQ (Reports & filters)
Async/Await & Multithreading (Appointment scheduling)
Singleton & Factory Patterns (Hospital manager and staff creation)
Attributes & Reflection (Medical record export)
Exception Handling and IDisposable examples
